Team members:

Description:
An analysis of trends on traffic in the greater Austin area over the past 5 years.

Questions to answer:
How does time of year, day, weather, holiday, area, driver demographics affect traffic accidents?

Data sources: 
data.austintexas.gov


Endpoints:
1. scatterplot:
	- y axis = population, x axis = number of accidents that year, color = year (2013, etc)
2. pie plot:
	- traffic hazards, accidents, road impediments
3. bar graphs:
	- number of accidents per day, week, or month (x-axis = unit of time, y-axis = number of accidents)
	- holiday comparison (+/- 1 day around holiday)
4. "heat" map:
	- geographic map of where accidents occur


Assumptions:
 - traffic hazards are differentiated from traffic accidents
 - compare frequency of accidents to population growth
